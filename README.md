# R Project: Build Machine Learning Model using R Studio to predict house prices in California.

In this R Project, we want to construct machine learning models to predict the price of houses in California based on different predictors such as houses’ locations, number of rooms, and the number of people residing in a block using a dataset that was collected in 1990. To do so, download the dataset “housing.csv”. Notice that this dataset contains the price of houses in 1990. Since the housing prices have increased dramatically since then, we cannot generalize our model to predict the the current price of houses in California.

The “housing” dataset contains 20640 observations and 10 variables (9 predictors and 1 response). Below is a list of the variables with descriptions.
• longitude: A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west
• latitude: A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north
• housing median age: Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building
• total rooms: Total number of rooms within a block
• total bedrooms: Total number of bedrooms within a block
• population: Total number of people residing within a block
• households: Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block
• median income: Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars)
• ocean proximity: Location of the house w.r.t ocean/sea
• median house value: Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars) 

Perform the following tasks to build a linear regression and a decision tree model to predict the housing prices.
